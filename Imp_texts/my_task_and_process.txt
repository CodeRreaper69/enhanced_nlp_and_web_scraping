Data Extraction and NLP 
Test Assignment 
1 Objective 
The objective of this assignment is to extract textual data articles from the given URL and 
perform text analysis to compute variables that are explained below.  
2 Data Extraction 
Input.xlsx 
For each of the articles, given in the input.xlsx file, extract the article text and save the extracted 
article in a text file with URL_ID as its file name. 
While extracting text, please make sure your program extracts only the article title and the article 
text. It should not extract the website header, footer, or anything other than the article text.  
NOTE: YOU MUST USE PYTHON PROGRAMMING TO EXTRACT DATA FROM 
THE URLs. YOU CAN USE BEATIFULSOUP, SELENIUM OR SCRAPY, OR ANY 
OTHER PYTHON LIBRARIES THAT YOU PREFER FOR DATA CRAWLING.  
3 Data Analysis 
For each of the extracted texts from the article, perform textual analysis and compute variables, 
given in the output structure excel file. You need to save the output in the exact order as given in 
the output structure file, “Output Data Structure.xlsx” 
NOTE: YOU MUST USE PYTHON PROGRAMMING FOR THE DATA ANALYSIS 
4 Variables 
The definition of each of the variables given in the “Text Analysis.docx” file. 
Look for these variables in the analysis document (Text Analysis.docx): 
1. POSITIVE SCORE 
2. NEGATIVE SCORE 
3. POLARITY SCORE 
4. SUBJECTIVITY SCORE 
5. AVG SENTENCE LENGTH 
6. PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS 
7. FOG INDEX 
8. AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE 
9. COMPLEX WORD COUNT 
10. WORD COUNT 
11. SYLLABLE PER WORD 
12. PERSONAL PRONOUNS 
13. AVG WORD LENGTH 
5 Output Data Structure 
Output Variables:  
1. All input variables in “Input.xlsx” 
2. POSITIVE SCORE 
3. NEGATIVE SCORE 
4. POLARITY SCORE 
5. SUBJECTIVITY SCORE 
6. AVG SENTENCE LENGTH 
7. PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS 
8. FOG INDEX 
9. AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE 
10. COMPLEX WORD COUNT 
11. WORD COUNT 
12. SYLLABLE PER WORD 
13. PERSONAL PRONOUNS 
14. AVG WORD LENGTH 
Check out the output data structure spreadsheet for the format of your output, i.e. “Output Data 
Structure.xlsx”. 
6 Timeline 
6 days, sooner is better.  
7 Where to submit 
To submit your solution, please fill out this Google form, upload your solution submission to Google 
Drive, and share the drive url in the Google form: https://forms.gle/nvWAgrCBdq1JkKou8  
Make sure your submission contains: 
a) .py file 
b) output in csv or Excel file as given in the output structure 
c) instructions documentation 
1. explaining how you approached the solution 
2. How to run the .py file to generate output 
3. Include all dependencies required 
Do not include any other file in the deliverable.

1 Sentimental Analysis 
Sentimental analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, 
negative, or neutral. The below Algorithm is designed for use in Financial Texts. It consists of 
steps: 
1.1 Cleaning using Stop Words Lists 
The Stop Words Lists (found in the folder StopWords) are used to clean the text so that 
Sentiment Analysis can be performed by excluding the words found in Stop Words List.  
1.2 Creating a dictionary of Positive and Negative words 
The Master Dictionary (found in the folder MasterDictionary) is used for creating a dictionary 
of Positive and Negative words. We add only those words in the dictionary if they are not found 
in the Stop Words Lists.  
1.3 Extracting Derived variables 
We convert the text into a list of tokens using the nltk tokenize module and use these tokens to 
calculate the 4 variables described below: 
Positive Score: This score is calculated by assigning the value of +1 for each word if found in 
the Positive Dictionary and then adding up all the values. 
Negative Score: This score is calculated by assigning the value of -1 for each word if found in 
the Negative Dictionary and then adding up all the values. We multiply the score with -1 so 
that the score is a positive number. 
Polarity Score: This is the score that determines if a given text is positive or negative in nature. 
It is calculated by using the formula:  
Polarity Score = (Positive Score – Negative Score)/ ((Positive Score + Negative Score) + 
0.000001) 
Range is from -1 to +1 
Subjectivity Score: This is the score that determines if a given text is objective or subjective. 
It is calculated by using the formula:  
2 | Page 
Subjectivity Score = (Positive Score + Negative Score)/ ((Total Words after cleaning) + 
0.000001) 
Range is from 0 to +1 
2 Analysis of Readability 
Analysis of Readability is calculated using the Gunning Fox index formula described below. 
Average Sentence Length = the number of words / the number of sentences 
Percentage of Complex words = the number of complex words / the number of words  
Fog Index = 0.4 * (Average Sentence Length + Percentage of Complex words) 
3 Average Number of Words Per Sentence 
The formula for calculating is: 
Average Number of Words Per Sentence = the total number of words / the total number of 
sentences 
4 Complex Word Count 
Complex words are words in the text that contain more than two syllables. 
5 Word Count 
We count the total cleaned words present in the text by  
1. removing the stop words (using stopwords class of nltk package). 
2. removing any punctuations like ? ! , . from the word before counting. 
3 | Page 
6 Syllable Count Per Word 
We count the number of Syllables in each word of the text by counting the vowels present in 
each word. We also handle some exceptions like words ending with "es","ed" by not counting 
them as a syllable. 
7 Personal Pronouns 
To calculate Personal Pronouns mentioned in the text, we use regex to find the counts of the 
words - “I,” “we,” “my,” “ours,” and “us”. Special care is taken so that the country name US 
is not included in the list. 
8 Average Word Length 
Average Word Length is calculated by the formula: 
Sum of the total number of characters in each word/Total number of words
